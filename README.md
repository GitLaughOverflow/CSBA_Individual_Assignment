# CSBA_Individual_Assignment

The task at hand involves identifying duplicate entries within an extensive collection of 1624 product descriptions for TVs gathered from the web. 
To achieve this, I implemented a preselection step, by the application of locality-sensitive hashing to the dataset. 
This process helps identify potential duplicate candidates, thus minimizing the computational cost of subsequent duplicate detection 
performed using Difflib.m
